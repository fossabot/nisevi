# Puma supports spawning multiple workers. It will fork out a process at the
# OS level to support concurrent requests. This typically requires more RAM
WEB_CONCURRENCY=1

# Puma supports threading. Requests are served through an internal thread pool.
# Even more MIR, it is beneficial to leverage multiple threads because I/O operations
# do not lock the GIL. This typically requires more CPU.
MIN_THREADS=1

# This will be the address and port that Puma binds to. The only real
# reason you would ever change this is if you have another service running
# that must be on port 8000
#
# This is commented out because it defaults to the value listed below
# LISTEN_ON="0.0.0.0:8000"

# Requests that exceed 5 seconds will be terminated and dumped to a stack trace.
# REQUEST_TIMEOUT=5
